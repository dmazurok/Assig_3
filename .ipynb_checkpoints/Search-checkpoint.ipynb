According to the U.S. Senate Historical Office, he is the fifth African American Senator in U.S. history and is one of the Democratic candidates for President in 2008. >> Tips for Reading This Family Tree First Generation: 1. Barack Hussein OBAMA was born on 4 August 1961 at the Queen\\'s Medical Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Barack Hussein OBAMA, Sr. of Nyangoma-Kogelo, Siaya District, Kenya, and Ann DUNHAM of Wichita, Kansas. His parents met while both were attending the East-West Center of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was enrolled as a foreign student. When Barack Obama was two years old, his parents divorced and his father moved to Connecticut to continue his education before returning to Kenya.When Obama was six, his mother married Lolo Soetoro, an Indonesian oil manager. In 1967, when Soetoro\\'s student visa was revoked because of political unrest in Indonesia, Dunham and Barack, then in first grade, accompanied him to Jakarta, Indonesia. Obama\\'s half-sister, Maya Soetoro was born after the family moved to Indonesia. Four years later she sent him back to the United States to live with his maternal grandmother. Barack Obama graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he met his future wife, Michelle Robinson. They have two daughters, Malia and Sasha. Second Generation (Parents): 2.

Another had two brothers killed by American Indians, who scalped one brother and kidnapped the other\\'s daughter. White House hopeful Barack Obama already has presidential timber in his family tree: He is distantly related to three U.S. presidents. PHOTO GALLERY Obama Family Tree RELATED STORIES Bios of Obama family members Interactive: Obama\\'s family tree Special section: Barack Obama PDF: Obama\\'s family tree Political coverage: Lynn Sweet\\'s blog Sources To trace Barack Obama\\'s heritage, the Sun-Times started with his book, Dreams From My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance, and the genealogical research of William Addams Reitwiesner on Reitwiesner\\'s Web site, www.wargs.com . In addition, we verified information and dug up new facts with documents on Ancestry.com , in state archives, from public libraries and from other sources. Those who helped include Sam Dunnam of Dunham-Singletary Family Connections, Donna Dodson of the Newton County (Ark.) Historical Society, Virginia genealogist Brigitte Burkett, genealogist Christopher Challender Child of the New England Historic Genealogical Society, David Lee Dunham, Leon McCurry, Robert Mardock, Rae Janette McCurry Marshall, Virginia Goeldner and Maya Soetoro-Ng. Still another ancestor was said to have been slain by pirates. Yet another lost a son in the Civil War to pro-slavery bushwackers who torched the man\\'s home and threw burning coals on his infant daughter. And, four centuries ago, his great- great-great-great-great-great- great-great-grandfather was a respected warrior and leader in eastern Africa. It would take an orchard to contain all of Sen. Barack Obama\\'s diverse ancestral branches. Obama -- who has seven half-brothers and half-sisters spread across more than 10,000 miles -- has ancestors who were born in Kenya, England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany and the Netherlands, the Sun-Times found in an exhaustive look at the South Side Democratic presidential hopeful\\'s family history. Obama\\'s heritage is a key part of his public persona. He explored his ancestry in his memoir, Dreams From My Father, asking: \"What is a family? Is it just a genetic chain, parents and offspring, people like me?\" And when he introduced himself to the nation in his 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote speech, Obama said he was \"grateful for the diversity of my heritage.\" \"I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth is my story even possible,\" he told a packed convention hall in Boston. Our research began with Obama\\'s own writings and genealogical work already done by William Addams Reitwiesner and other researchers. Then, we pored over documents on Ancestry.com and from other sources and interviewed descendants, historians and genealogists. Like many Americans with deep roots in this country, Obama has ancestors who were slave owners. But unlike many African Americans, he is not known to have any who were slaves. Obama definitely has presidential timber in his family tree: He\\'s distantly related to three U.S. presidents -- Harry S Truman, George W. Bush and George Herbert Walker Bush -- as well as to Vice President Dick Cheney. Which, genealogists say, isn\\'t all that unusual, particulary for people with ancestors from New England. \"I found I\\'m related to 18 presidents,\" said Christopher Challender Child, a genealogist with the New England Historic Genealogical Society who has researched Obama\\'s ancestry. \"With presidents with New England ancestry, you will find a lot of them are related to one another.\" Bush and his father, for instance, are distantly related to 16 other presidents. And Franklin Delano Roosevelt shared ancestors with 17 others. And, as dramatic as some of the leaves on Obama\\'s family tree might seem, Child said most people who trace their lineage back several generations would find comparable intrigue. \"They\\'re interesting,\" the genealogist said of Obama\\'s ancestors. \"But a lot of people will find they have similar interesting stories.\" Even a distant Obama relative downplayed the family\\'s past. \"I didn\\'t find too many unusual things,\" said Rae Janette McCurry Marshall, 77, who is a first cousin, twice removed, of Obama. \"The most unusual was that Sen. Obama is in our family. We never had anyone that famous.\" Not that that guarantees Obama her vote. \"I\\'ve always been a staunch Republican,\" said Marshall, a retired schoolteacher and bowling alley operator from El Reno, Okla. \"I\\'d like to know where he stands on a lot of things.\" You can find your family, too Is George Washington in your family tree? Or maybe . . . Benedict Arnold? There\\'s no telling what you might find once you start rooting around in your family\\'s past. Genealogy has always been a popular hobby. And now, thanks to the Internet, census records, birth and death information, oral histories and the like are more accessible than ever, experts say. Researching your genealogy can be consuming, though. Some amateurs spend decades tracing the roots and branches of their family trees.

To many in this crowd Obama's Asian-American half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, represents yet another aspect of Obama's identity that makes him unique as a presidential candidate, although it has been underplayed amid the excitement surrounding his shot at becoming the first black president. Maya Soetoro-Ng of Honolulu is the half sister of Barack Obama; (inset) Obama, 9, right, with his mother Ann Dunham, center, his Indonesian step-father Lolo Soetoro, and his sister Maya Soetoro in 1970. (AP files) Obama Family Tree RELATED STORIES Obama shows he can go right Bios of Obama's family members Interactive: Obama's family tree PDF: Obama's family tree Read Lynn Sweet's blog Special section: Barack Obama ''It would be the first time that the first family is comprised in part of Asian-Americans -- as well as African-Americans, of course,'' said Keith Kamisugi, a coordinator with Asian-Americans for Obama. In early June he organized a fundraiser along with two other Obama events focusing on Asian-American voters in San Francisco. Discussion of those ties has taken a back seat to the Obama campaign's efforts to win the Hispanic vote and his ability to rouse young and black voters. In spite of the drawn-out primary season, many voters have heard little about Obama's years in Jakarta -- he lived there between 1967 and 1971, while his mother was married to Soetoro-Ng's father, an Indonesian businessman -- or about his years in Hawaii, where Asian-Americans are a majority. Soetoro-Ng and Obama have different fathers and the same mother. Her father is Indonesian, his is Kenyan. Her husband is Chinese-Canadian. Initially, as the campaign focused on fighting out the primaries, state by state, ''the idea was to downplay to some degree race and ethnicity,'' said Soetoro-Ng in an interview with The Associated Press. ''A lot of the emphasis had been on reaching out, making connections, closing the gaps.'' That theme resonated among Obama supporters of all backgrounds, said Soetoro-Ng, who is nine years younger than Obama and considers him ''the strong male force'' in her life after her parents' divorce. It was with Obama she attended her first blues concert and her first voter registration drive, she said. The two remain close: She was there when Obama's oldest daughter, Malia, 9, was born, and plans to help celebrate her 10th birthday on the 4th of July, on the campaign trail. Soetoro-Ng's appearances give voters a chance to get to know Obama as a person, not just an elected official. Her stories illustrate the development of his character, from his days as a teenager who loved basketball and bodysurfing and didn't always get the strongest grades, to his growing sense of civic duty in the summers she spent with him in Chicago. But she also has a political role to play. She plans to spend her summer vacation -- she is a teacher at an all-girls' school in Hawaii -- introducing her brother to crowds such as this one. ''We are ready for a more complex construction of identity as a country,'' she said, dismissing the possibility some voters might find it hard to relate to Obama's multiethnic background and foreign experience. ''Maybe not everybody is as mixed or as hybrid as he is. But he gets Kansas, because we have Kansas,'' she said, referring to their mother's background. ''He gets the Midwest. He gets the south side of Chicago.'' And he ''has a lot of affection for Asian cultures, in all of their various forms,'' she said. That cultural variety is among the reasons Asian-American and Pacific Islander voters have gotten less attention than other ethnic groups from the media -- or even from the Obama campaign -- during the primary season. Asian-American voters represent about 5 percent of the population, or about 15.4 million people, but their communities are scattered around the country and harbor deep cultural and geopolitical differences that bleed into their voting behavior and ensure that many remain independent, harder to court. ''I'm not surprised we haven't had as much attention as Latinos and African-Americans,'' said Kamisugi. ''We're underdeveloped and under-recognized'' as voters. In 2004, 56 percent of Asian-Americans voted for Democrat John Kerry and 44 percent for President Bush, according to exit poll data. ''It's not an easily definable vote,'' said Tony Quinn, a California political analyst. ''You can't talk about it as a voting bloc -- it's not.'' Asians make up one-fourth of the foreign-born population in the United States; many are first-generation immigrants. That presents a challenge to politicians, said Gautam Dutta, executive director of the Asian American Action Fund,a political action committee whose goal is to increase Asian-American political participation. ''You can't have a one-size-fits-all approach,'' Dutta said. This may explain why an event billed as the community's first National Presidential Town Hall, which drew about 2,000 Asian-American and Pacific Islander leaders, elected officials and voters in May got less attention from candidates who appeared and spoke before Hispanic and black civic organizations. Hillary Rodham Clinton made a video appearance, Obama took questions over the phone. There was no response from Republican John McCain's campaign. But some analysts argue that because Asian-Americans are just emerging as a political community engaging them now will pay off. Census numbers show their growing importance. The Asian-American population grew 3 percent between 2004 and 2005 -- more than another other group. And the Census projects the population will grow 213 percent by 2050, to 33.4 million. In some key states, their weight is already considerable. Besides Hawaii, where Asian-Americans are 57.5 percent of the population, and California, where they're 13.5 percent, Asians are 7.7 percent of New Jersey and Washington, and 7.2 percent of New York. In some races, even a comparatively small group can cast the key votes. In Virginia's 2006 Senate contest, Republican George Allen referred to an Indian-American as a ''macaca'' and the resulting outrage among Asians helped propel Democrat Jim Webb's come-from-behind victory. Webb won by 7,231 votes. ''Parties are hesitant to invest in communities where party loyalty is not fixed,'' said David Lee, who teaches political science at San Francisco State University, and heads the Chinese-American Voters Education Committee. ''But if you don't spend the money, if you don't invest in Asian voters, why should they be loyal?'' Soetoro-Ng, and her husband, Konrad Ng, a professor at the University of Hawaii, are already doing some of that work. Ng blogs on the Obama campaign's Web site, and Soetoro-Ng plans to continue to take time from her teaching throughout the fall to make phone calls to house parties, appear on radio broadcasts and perform other outreach for her brother. ''My brother is very interested in reaching out to communities,'' including Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, she said. ''You're going to see a lot of new reaching out. It will be more deliberate.''\")\n",
